During this project we are going to have look into the concept of Logistic regression.We have the sample data set coming from Docsme.
        On a broader perpespective, we are going to predict whether asset given in test file will opt for contract or not? 
**Introduction** 

We'll perform the following steps:

- Reading the dataset
- Cleaning and Missing value imputation
- Data Exporation and Preprocessing for Logisitics
- Logistics Regression Modelling
- Output Validation
- Gain Charts and Lift charts
 
 **Visualizing the data**
 
Starting off with reading the data for analysis,which is a CSV file.

```{r setup,echo=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
knitr::opts_knit$set(root.dir="C:\\Users\\1500202\\Documents\\NEW_R_Scripts")
```


tidyr-multi columns
fast_dummies- to make dummy variables
Rose- Removing class bias
Information- Info value Imputation
stringr- to get 2017
car-Vif


```{r}
sp<- read.csv('train_service.csv');
test <-read.csv('test_service.csv')
View(sp)
```
        
Having a first look at the data.
         
```{r}
str(sp); 
```

Now lets investigate for data.
```{r}
summary(sp)
```

Check for Class Bias
```{r}
table(sp$contract_flag)
table(sp$warrnty_flg)
```

There is a considerate bais in the dataset.
We will use the  rose function to remove bias and make it a well balanced data set.

```{r}
sp.rose <- ROSE( contract_flag ~ ., data = sp, seed = 1)$data
View(sp.rose)
```

Now the proportions look quite good as can be seen.

```{r}
table(sp.rose$contract_flag)
```

Lets have a look at the Boxplots and crosstables configurations.






Play with your data 
**Removing the Missing values**

Also We could have neglected the values as they are only 0.01 percent of the total dataSet.

```{r}
sp1<-subset(sp.rose,custmr_catgry_full!="")
test<-subset(test,custmr_catgry_full!="")
#View(sp1)
str(sp1)
```

**Getting Warranty End month and Year** 

Now lets split the warrnty_end_date variable to get Month an Year extracted

```{r}
sp1$Months <- substr(sp1$warrnty_end_dt,0,1)
sp1$yrsp <- str_sub(sp1$warrnty_end_dt,-4,-1)
test$Months <- substr(test$warrnty_end_dt,0,1)
test$year <- str_sub(test$warrnty_end_dt,-4,-1)
View(test)
```

```{r}
drops <- c("inputrowindex","warrnty_end_mnth","warrnty_end_dt","warrnty_start_dt","asset_nbr","install_dt","yrsp")
wok1 <- sp1[ , !(names(sp1) %in% drops)]
str(wok1)
#View(wok1)
```


```{r}
model_logit <- glm(contract_flag ~ .,family=binomial(link='logit'),data=wok1)
summary(model_logit)
#predicted <- plogis(predict(model_logit,test))
#View(predicted)
```

```{r}
optCutOff <- optimalCutoff(test$contract_flag, predicted)[1]
optCutOff
```
